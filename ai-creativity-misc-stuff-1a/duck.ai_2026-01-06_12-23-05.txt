### Example 1: Local Python Scripts

You can create and run Python scripts that process text directly on your local machine. Follow these steps:

#### Writing the Code Locally

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. **Example Code**: Here’s a simple script that generates text using predefined prompts.
   ```python
   # Local text generation script (local_generator.py)
   import random

   def generate_content():
       prompts = [
           "Write a funny story about a dog.",
           "Describe a day in the life of a cat.",
           "Create a poem about the ocean."
       ]
       return random.choice(prompts)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       result = generate_content()
       print(result)
   ```

#### Running the Code

- Save the script in your Obsidian vault.
- Run the script via the terminal:
  ```bash
  python path/to/local_generator.py
  ```

The output can then be copied back into your Obsidian notes.

---

### Example 2: Markdown Templates with Fillable Sections

You can create templates that serve as prompts for manual input, which can later be processed or formatted.

1. **Create a Markdown Template**:
   ```markdown
   ## Creative Writing Prompt
   
   - **Prompt**: Write a story about a time traveler.
   - **Your Response**: 
   ```
2. **Filling in the Response**: You fill in the "Your Response" section directly in your note, capturing your creative thoughts.

---

### Example 3: Use Local Markdown Processors

Utilize Markdown processors that facilitate content generation without relying on external APIs. Some Markdown editors support embedded scripts or local processing.

#### Using Pandoc or Other Tools
You can convert Markdown files to other formats or process them in certain ways. 

1. **Install Pandoc**:
   - Download and install Pandoc if you haven't already.

2. **Using a Local Script for Processing**:
   - You can write a shell script that runs specific commands on your Markdown files to format or modify them.

---

### Example 4: Utilizing Code Blocks in Obsidian

Obsidian allows you to create code blocks directly within your notes. You can include text manipulation scripts without executing them live.

1. **Create a Code Block**:
   ```markdown
   ## Text Manipulation Example

   ```python
   # This script needs to be run in a local Python environment
   text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
   print(text.upper())  # Outputs: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.
   ```

2. **Manual Execution**:
   - You will manually copy this code to your local Python environment to see the output.

---

### Tips for Non-API Integration

- **Create a Local Workflow**: Use a series of scripts and notes that interact with each other. For example, create scripts for different types of content (summaries, stories, etc.) and save the outputs in corresponding notes.
- **Batch Processing**: Write scripts that can read from multiple Markdown files and process them in bulk.

---

By adopting these non-API methods, you can still achieve dynamic content generation and manage your notes effectively in Obsidian, all without relying on external APIs. This allows for more control and customization of your processing workflows.

## Creating a Todo List with Claude AI as an Agent

Integrating Claude AI as an agent for managing a todo list can enhance its functionality by allowing it to provide recommendations, prioritize tasks, and even generate follow-up prompts. Here’s a structured way to implement this concept.

---

### Step 1: Define Your Todo List Structure

Create a simple text-based todo list structure where tasks can be stored, along with their priorities and statuses (e.g., pending, completed).

```markdown
# Todo List

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Complete project report (Priority: High)
- [ ] Task 2: Grocery shopping (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Task 3: Call the dentist (Priority: Low)
```

---

### Step 2: Write Local Claude AI Code

For this example, we'll simulate how Claude could assist by providing recommendations based on your list and priorities. Since we're avoiding the use of an API, we'll write some local code.

#### Example Code

Here’s a Python script that helps manage your todo list by generating suggestions based on your current tasks.

```python
import random

# Sample todo list
tasks = [
    {"task": "Complete project report", "priority": "High", "status": "Pending"},
    {"task": "Grocery shopping", "priority": "Medium", "status": "Pending"},
    {"task": "Call the dentist", "priority": "Low", "status": "Pending"},
]

def get_recommendation(tasks):
    """Generate task recommendations based on priority."""
    high_priority_tasks = [task for task in tasks if task['priority'] == 'High']
    medium_priority_tasks = [task for task in tasks if task['priority'] == 'Medium']
    
    if high_priority_tasks:
        return f"Focus on: {random.choice(high_priority_tasks)['task']}"
    elif medium_priority_tasks:
        return f"Consider: {random.choice(medium_priority_tasks)['task']}"
    else:
        return "All tasks are low priority. Take your time."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    recommendation = get_recommendation(tasks)
    print(recommendation)
```

---

### Step 3: Using This Code in Obsidian

1. **Save the Script**: Save this script as `todo_manager.py` in your Obsidian vault.

2. **Referencing in Obsidian**:
   ```markdown
   ## Todo List Management

   # Tasks
   - [ ] Task 1: Complete project report (Priority: High)
   - [ ] Task 2: Grocery shopping (Priority: Medium)
   - [ ] Task 3: Call the dentist (Priority: Low)

   ## Recommendations
   Execute the script below to get recommendations based on your tasks:

   ```python
   ![Run Todo Manager](path/to/todo_manager.py)
   ```

3. **Execution**: Run the script through your terminal. It will provide suggestions based on your current tasks.

---

### Step 4: Enhancements and Skills

To further integrate Claude AI-like capabilities:

- **Prioritize Tasks**: Add functionalities to rearrange tasks based on urgency or deadlines.
- **Task Follow-ups**: Create a note-taking feature that records follow-up tasks or notes along with original tasks.
- **Weekly Review**: Write a script that summarizes completed tasks and suggests new ones based on patterns in your todo entries.

#### A Sample Enhancement Code for Follow-ups
```python
def add_follow_up(task):
    """Add a follow-up task."""
    follow_ups = [
        f"Follow-up on {task}: How did it go?",
        f"Check on progress for {task}."
    ]
    return random.choice(follow_ups)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    completed_task = "Grocery shopping"
    follow_up = add_follow_up(completed_task)
    print(follow_up)
```

---

### Conclusion

By creating a simple todo list integrated with Claude AI functionalities, you enhance the productivity of your task management. This method allows you to harness local scripts for recommendations, task prioritization, and more, all contained within your Obsidian environment.

## Summary of Prompts and Code for Integration with Claude AI in Obsidian

Integrating prompts, text-to-speech (TTS), and keyboard shortcuts into your Obsidian note-taking system can enhance functionality and improve user interaction. Below is a concise summary of prompts and relevant code examples.

---

### 1. Prompts for Interactive Inputs

Prompts allow you to gather user input dynamically, facilitating interactive content generation.

#### Example Code for Interactive Prompt:

```python
def get_user_input(prompt):
    user_input = input(prompt)
    return user_input

if __name__ == "__main__":
    long_note = get_user_input("Enter the text you want to summarize: ") 
```

### 2. Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration

Text-to-speech functionality can make your notes more accessible by converting written text to audio.

#### Example Code for TTS:

```python
from gtts import gTTS
import os

def convert_text_to_speech(text):
    tts = gTTS(text, lang='en')
    tts.save("speech.mp3")
    os.system("start speech.mp3")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    text_input = input("Enter the text you want to convert to speech: ")
```

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts for Efficiency

Custom keyboard shortcuts enhance workflow efficiency by allowing quick execution of scripts.

#### Setting Up Hotkeys in Obsidian:
- Navigate to **Settings > Hotkeys**.
- Bind specific keys to run your Python scripts easily.
