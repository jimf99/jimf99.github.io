### **Bible References (New King James Version)**

**Ephesians 2:8-9**
> "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast."

**Acts 4:12**
> "Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."

**Romans 10:9**
> "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."

**Romans 1:18-32 (Summarized, as the full chapter is long. Key themes of God's wrath on unrighteousness and humanity's rejection of God are central.)**
> "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man—and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things. Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them."

**Romans 6:23**
> "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."

**John 3:16**
> "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."

**John 14:6**
> "Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."

**Romans 10:10**

> "whom having not seen you love. Though now you do not see Him, yet believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith—the salvation of your souls."

**1 John 5:11-13**
> "And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God."

**Luke 19:10**

**Romans 5:8**

**Titus 3:5**

**1 Corinthians 6:9-10**

### **Sermon Notes: The Unshakeable Hope of Salvation**

**Opening:**
* Engage audience with a question about hope/security.
* Briefly introduce the pervasive problem of sin and humanity's lostness.
* Present salvation as God's answer, a hope that anchors the soul.

**I. The Universal Need for Salvation**
    * **The Problem:** We are all sinners. No exceptions (Romans 3:23). This isn't just about "bad" people; it's a universal condition.
    * **The Consequence:** Sin leads to death (Romans 6:23). Not just physical death, but spiritual separation from God, which is the ultimate consequence.
    * **God's Perspective on Sin:** Romans 1 clearly shows God's righteous anger against ungodliness. Humanity, though knowing God, chose to suppress that truth and embrace idolatry and immorality. This isn't God being arbitrary; it's a just response to rebellion.
    * **The Law's Purpose:** The law (1 Timothy 1:9) exposes our sin, showing us our need for a Savior, rather than being a means to earn salvation. It acts as a mirror, not a ladder.
    * **No Self-Help:** Emphasize that no amount of good deeds, religious rituals, or personal effort can bridge the gap created by sin (Ephesians 2:8-9, Titus 3:5). Salvation is an act of God's grace, not human merit. This frees us from the burden of trying to "be good enough."

**II. The Divine Provision for Salvation**
    * **God's Initiative:** Salvation isn't our idea; it's God's. His motivation is profound love (John 3:16). Before we even thought of Him, He loved us and acted on our behalf (Romans 5:8). This highlights His immense mercy and desire for relationship (2 Peter 3:9).
    * **Jesus, the Only Solution:** This is a crucial point of distinction in Christianity. Jesus isn't *a* way; He is *the* way (John 14:6, Acts 4:12). He came specifically to "seek and to save that which was lost" (Luke 19:10).
    * **The Atonement:** Explain 2 Corinthians 5:21 – Jesus, who was perfectly righteous, took our sin upon Himself on the cross, so that we could be clothed in His righteousness. This is the heart of the gospel.

**III. The Human Response to Salvation**
    * **More Than Head Knowledge:** Belief unto salvation involves the heart, not just intellectual assent (Romans 10:9-10). It's a conviction that transforms us.
    * **Receiving and Becoming:** John 1:12-13 speaks of "receiving" Jesus and thereby gaining the "right to become children of God." This is a supernatural birth, not a physical one.
    * **The Necessity of Faith:** John 3:36 starkly contrasts belief with unbelief, emphasizing the eternal consequences.
    * **The Act of Confession:** Confession (Romans 10:9-10) is the outward expression of an inward belief. It's a public acknowledgment of Jesus' Lordship. Calling on the name of the Lord signifies dependence and surrender (Acts 2:21). The example in Acts 16:17, though from a demon-possessed girl, illustrates how the "way of salvation" is proclaimed.

**IV. The Fruit of Salvation**
    * **Radical Transformation:** Being "in Christ" means a fundamental change, a new identity (2 Corinthians 5:17). Old habits, desires, and ways of thinking begin to fade, replaced by new ones aligned with God's Spirit.
    * **Inner Assurance and Joy:** One of the most precious fruits is the knowledge of eternal life (1 John 5:11-13). This assurance brings a deep, inexpressible joy (1 Peter 1:8-9), even amidst trials. It's not a fleeting happiness, but a settled peace.
    * **Foundational Trust:** Psalm 62 beautifully portrays a life anchored in God as our rock, salvation, and refuge. This is the ongoing posture of a believer – continually trusting God, pouring out our hearts to Him, and finding strength in Him alone. This trust is what makes our hope "unshakeable."

**Conclusion:**
* Reiterate the core message: Salvation is by grace through faith in Christ alone.
* Issue a clear, compassionate call to action:
    * For the unsaved: Emphasize the urgency and simplicity of responding to God's offer of salvation. Encourage a personal prayer of repentance and faith.
    * For believers: Encourage deeper living in their salvation, walking in newness of life, experiencing the joy and assurance, and sharing this profound hope with others.
* End with a powerful prayer, inviting response and blessing.
